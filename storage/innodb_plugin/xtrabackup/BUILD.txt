How to build XtraBackup
=======================

!!You should build your MySQL before the building XtraBackup!!

1. Put this directory to innobase/ directory.
   (e.g. mysql-5.0.75/innobase/xtrabackup-0.0 )

2. From the innodbase directory, apply the xtrabackup patch and then re-make.
   The patch is fix_innodb_for_backup.patch for MySQL 5.0 and
   fix_innodb_for_backup51.patch for MySQL 5.1.
   ('make clean' at innobase/ dir may be needed for 5.0, because of the lack of dependency)

3. Run make in the XtraBackup directory.

4. enjoy... :)
